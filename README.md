# 🌸 Sephora Beauty Market Analysis

## Introduction
This project analyzes a large dataset of Sephora beauty products to understand modern beauty market trends.  
Using product attributes such as price, reviews, ratings, ingredients, and marketing highlights, the analysis uncovers patterns related to consumer behavior, brand performance, pricing strategy, and the rise of clean beauty.  
The full exploration, visualizations, and insights are documented inside the notebook.

## Objectives
- Explore the structure of Sephora's product dataset

## Final Insights
This project highlights key beauty-market dynamics, including:
- Engagement metrics (reviews, loves) are stronger indicators of product success than price  
- Price and rating show weak correlation — customers value performance, claims, and trust over cost  
- Brand success depends on consistent marketing, community reputation, and clear product benefits  
- Clean beauty continues to rise, though marketing claims often exceed true ingredient standards  
- Top-performing products share common themes such as “vegan,” “cruelty-free,” and “hydrating”

Detailed analysis and visual evidence are available inside the notebook.
